Its goal is to provide accessible and reliable information, support inclusivity, and encourage understanding of ADHD in diverse communities.

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. I used bootstrap to give me variations on the columns so that the design is responsive to all devices.
